# stressors_and_coral_reefs
This repository is for R code analyzing how multiple stressors impact the spatial distribution of living coral in the central Philippines.  This is an update from stressors and reefs to use updated R spatial packages (e.g., terra, sf). Note that only code used to create files for final analysis are updated. 

Original code from my PhD is available in the stressors_and_reefs repository.
